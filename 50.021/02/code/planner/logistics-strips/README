Domain: logistics
Version: logistics-strips

This directory contains a collection of logistics
problems. This domain was originally developed by
Manuela Veloso.

We use the pure strips style encoding (no equality,
no types). See domain01.pddl for operators. Original
operator file is by Dan Weld. We made some minor
fixes. See file header.

prob001 --- prob009 are based on instances
	reported in the literature, including:

		Henry Kautz and Bart Selman, "Pushing the Envelope:
		Planning, Propositional Logic, and Stochastic Search",
		Proc. AAAI-96.

		Henry Kautz and Bart Selman, "The Role of
		Domain-Specific Knowledge in the Planning as Satisfiability Framework",
		Proc. AIPS-98, Pittsburgh, PA, 1998.
	
prob009 --- prob030 are generated using GenLogStrips.c.

control.pddl and control1.pddl -- control rule files.

All instances are tested and correctness verified.

Problems prob020 and prob028 are particularly hard!  To solve them, try 

-solver -maxsec 30 graphplan -then -maxsec 0 compact -b 8 -then satz -cutoff 100 -restart 50

To see the how control rules help, try

blackbox -o domain.pddl -f prob020.pddl -c control.pddl -axioms 31 -t 15 -solver compact -b -then relsat -maxbt 10000 -trials 20

Collected by Henry Kautz and Bart Selman.
